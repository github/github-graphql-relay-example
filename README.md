### Running locally

First, you'll need a GitHub API access token to make GraphQL API requests. You can get that [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new).

```
$ git clone https://github.com/github/github-graphql-relay-example
$ cd github-graphql-relay-example/
$ yarn start
```

Once your server is running, you can open http://localhost:3000.
